I am an MSc Geography student in the department of Geography and Environmental Studies at Carleton University specializing in Data Science with an undergraduate degree in Geomatics. My research is focused on the use of remotely sensed data and machine learning techniques to improve our understanding of the extent, spatial distribution, and characteristics of Canadian peatlands. Currently, I am using a synthesis of optical and radar imagery, terrain metrics, and forest structure variables to produce a classification of peatland sub-classes (e.g. poor fen, rich fen, etc) for the Canadian boreal forest region. I also aim to create an inventory of peatland vegetation characteristics using data from Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI) and ICESat-2
