I am a PhD Geography student in the department of Geography and Environmental Studies at Carleton University specializing in Data Science with an undergraduate degree in Geomatics. My research is focused on the use of remotely sensed data and machine learning techniques to improve our understanding of the extent, spatial distribution, and characteristics of Canadian peatlands.
