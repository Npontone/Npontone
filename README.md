I am an MSc student at Carleton University in the Department of Geography and Environmental Studies. My research is primarily focused on the developent of novel space-based methodologies for monitoring peatland hydrological status. Currently, I am aiming to improve soil moisture retrieval from SMAP/SMOS brightness temperature data by characterizing peatland vegetation using Global Ecosystem Dynamics (GEDI) and ICESat-2 data.
